  # Abstract factory for providing configured `HTTP::Client` instances used to
  # communicate with AWS S3. This allows different implementations to manage
  # client lifecycle â€” such as creating a new client per request, reusing a persistent
  # connection, or implementing client pooling.

    # for making signed HTTP requests to AWS services.
