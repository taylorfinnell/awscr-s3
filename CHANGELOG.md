# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Introduced a `Presigner` class to simplify generating presigned URLs and forms. (#150, thanks @treagod)
- Add `status`, `status_message` and `headers` attributes to all response objects. (#151, thanks @treagod)

### Removed

- The deprecated HTTP initialization interface. (#144, thanks @miry)

### Changed

- The `bulk_delete` method now raises `ArgumentError` instead of `S3::Exception` when the number of keys is 0 or exceeds 1000. (#145, thanks @miry)

## [0.10.0] - 2025-04-21

### Changed

- Move endpoint to client and expose it. (#130, thanks @treagod)
- Introduce a factory-based mechanism for `Awscr::S3::Http`, allowing for custom connection strategies (e.g. pooling). (#139, thanks @treagod)

### Chores

- Add release and fix CI badges to README. (#135, thanks @treagod)
- Support Crystal 1.16. (#136, thanks @miry)

### Removed

- The presigned old interfaces without aws_session_key argument. (#137, thanks @miry)

### Breaking

- `Awscr::S3::Http` no longer caches a single `HTTP::Client` for all requests. By default, each request now acquires a fresh client via the new factory. If you relied on persistent keep-alives or a single client across requests, consider implementing a custom factory to retain the old behavior.
